# My Wing Experience
A Rails app that allows a user to create an account, can edit, or delete their account, and will allow the user to add wings to their account as a collection

Installation
Make sure the repo has been cloned and forked on an IDE before running the application.

In the terminal, type:

$ bundle install
This will install all of the gems needed to run the application

After that, type:

$ rails server or rails s
This will generate a local server to add to a web browser of choice (prefer Google Chrome).  

Usage
Instructions:

Type 'localhost:3000' in your web browser and this will bring you to the login page. 
Since the user is a first time user, the user will need to sign up.

Once the user has signed up for an account, the user will be redirected to the profile page, where they will have the ability to add 
restaurants to their page and can also log out of their account.

After adding a restaurant to their account, the user will be able to select that restaurant and add games to that restaurant under their account.  

Have fun with this application!

Development
There was no local testing for this application. This application was built from the ground up and tested within the terminal to ensure the code was properly working. This application was built from the ground up with the help of countless hours of google searching, the inspiration of learning to code with Flatiron School, and the never ending support from students and staff.
